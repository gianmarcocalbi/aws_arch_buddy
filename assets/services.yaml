  SQS - Long Polling: When the wait time for the ReceiveMessage API action (WaitTimeSeconds) is greater than 0 or the queue attribute ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds is set to 0, then long polling is in effect. The maximum long polling wait time is 20 seconds. Long polling helps reduce the cost of using Amazon SQS by eliminating the number of empty responsesWhen you enable long polling, the ReceiveMessage call doesn't return a response until a message arrives in the queue, or the long poll times out. The long poll wait time is 20 seconds. The maximum is 20 seconds.
  SQS - Message Visibility Timeout: When a consumer receives and processes a message from a queue, the message remains in the queue. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically delete the message. Because Amazon SQS is a distributed system, there's no guarantee that the consumer actually receives the message (for example, due to a connectivity issue or due to an issue in the consumer application). Thus, the consumer must delete the message from the queue after receiving and processing it. Immediately after the message is received, it remains in the queue. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a visibility timeout, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours.
  SQS - Priority or items: You cannot set a priority to individual items in the SQS queue. Use separate queues to provide prioritization of work.
  SQS - Retention Period: Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages that have been in a queue for more than the maximum message retention period. The default message retention period is 4 days. The minimum is 1 minute. The maximum is 14 days.
  SQS - Short Polling: When a message is available in the queue, a call to ReceiveMessage returns immediately with the message. Short polling is the default behavior where a weighted random set is sampled to determine which messages are returned. If no messages are available in the queue, the call returns immediately with an empty response. Short polling is the default behavior for ReceiveMessage.
  SQS Dead-Letter Queue: A secondary queue for handling failed or unprocessed messages in Amazon SQS. AWS SQS Dead-Letter Queues help prevent message loss and enable debugging.
